# AstrBot documentation

This directory contains the documentation sources for the current
[Xero-Team/AstrBot](https://github.com/Xero-Team/AstrBot) branch. When this
fork differs from upstream tutorials, the code, configuration defaults, API
specification, and deployment files in this repository are authoritative.

- Chinese sources: `docs/zh/`
- English sources: `docs/en/`
- Site navigation and theme: `docs/.vitepress/`
- Published developer OpenAPI document: `docs/public/openapi.json`

## Local preview

The pinned pnpm version is declared in `docs/package.json`. Use Corepack so the
same toolchain is used locally and in CI.

```bash
cd docs
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm run docs:dev
```

Build the production site with:

```bash
cd docs
corepack pnpm run docs:build
```

Do not edit `docs/.vitepress/dist/`; it is generated and ignored. When a
backend route or OpenAPI schema changes, regenerate the published API document
from the repository root:

```bash
uv run python docs/scripts/update_openapi_json.py
node node_modules/prettier/bin/prettier.cjs --write docs/public/openapi.json
```

The formatting step uses the root repository tooling installed by
`make bootstrap` or `corepack npm ci`.

User-facing changes should update both language trees when an equivalent page
exists. Keep internal links extensionless so VitePress validates them during
the production build.
